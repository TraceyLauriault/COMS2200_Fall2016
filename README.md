# Course Description

> The collection of data about us starts just before we are born. Data about us are collected when we go to school, enter the labour force, often with the help of unique IDs such as SIN#s. Data are also produced as we go about our daily activities – when we shop, bank, make phone calls, order a taxi, use social media, navigate the city, vote, exercise, and file taxes. Data are also collected as we do exceptional things such as cross international borders, check into hospital, when we commit crimes, at death and even afterward depending on what happens to our bodies, how our families and friends commemorate and remember us and if our actions are archived. We are datafied, and living a dataless life is nearly impossible as is ‘living below the radar’ since we each have a data double that leaves behind data shadows.
 
> In this course we examine what data generated by and about us do, how they are used, who owns them, and if and when linked, filtered through algorithms, search engines or visualized into maps, how they shape actions and material outcomes.

> The course covers a wide range of topics, themes and concepts such as data infrastructures, smart cities, the internet of things (IoT), surveillance and sousveillance, social physics, algorithmic governance, predictive policing, the quantified self, location based services, data collection devices and geodemographics among many others. 

# Course Objectives

The objectives of this course are to:

* Distinguish big data from small data, and to recognize data types;

* Conceptualize data as part of socio-technological and political processes, as a form of discourse and as media;

* Recognize the interconnections between data, their infrastructures, collection and dissemination technologies, software, platforms and how data are produced and used;

* Identify data politics;

* Understand the construction of facts and the framing of the truth.

## Week 1 (Sept.12) – Introduction

Welcome to the class! We will get to know each other, go over the course outline, class deliverables, learning objectives and discuss a provocative short essay. There will be an in-class group based guided datasets exercise (see the datasets below). Students will learn to critically read a dataset, describe it and discuss the social shaping qualities of data.


> **Assignment 1: Describing a Dataset (Due Week 3 @ 5PM Sept. 26) (10 %) 2 pages:** 

Read the description on CULearn. We will practice this in class.

 

> **INFOGRAPHIC A – (due Sept. 19)**

Go to the MacOdrum Library MADGIC section on the 1st Floor.  Peruse the COMS2200 Display.  Examine the books & maps and pick 3 that you find interesting. Cite those 3 books in the Week1 Forum, include the name of a chapter or section from each of those books that you think will help you with your infographic project and in a few sentences explain why. Any interesting and useful tips? Any useful examples?

 

## Week 2 (Sept. 19) – The Quantified You

In this lecture students learn about the quantified self and how the sensors they wear and/or carry in their pockets and/or are embedded in their bodies collect data about them. Students will examine an array of self-tracking data collection devices, why people quantify themselves and how their knowledge and understanding of themselves changes as a result. Students will also learn about personal story telling with data, the process of lifelogging, how the data one collects about oneself are shared with third parties with or without one’s consent. The following concepts will be discussed: quantified self, dataism, data shadows, data doubles, data doppleganger, cyborgs, biosensing, data privacy, data rights, data ownership and terms of use.

#### Readings

> **INFOGRAPHIC B – (due Sept. 26)**

Find 2 infographics.  The infographics can be about concepts, processes, a paper, a story, and should include data, etc.  Cite and share these in the class forum.  In a few words, explain why you selected these, how you found them, why you think they are good, discuss if there room for improvement? What would you do differently or how would you improve them?


## Week 3 (Sept. 26) – Counting You

In this lecture students learn about some of the infrastructures and institutions dedicated to counting them. They will discover why they matter to the nation and government administrations. They will begin to see the social shaping qualities of data and maps, and how they are part of social, technical and geographical imaginaries.  The in-class discussion will focus on the Census of Canada with an emphasis on the cancellation in 2010 and the reinstatement in 2016 of the Long-Form Census. Concepts such as governmentality, biopolitics, nation building, will be discussed and indicators will be introduced.

Cite those 2 resources in the forum and share a couple of useful tips, include ideas or examples that were striking to you. Test drive some of the infographic apps listed [here.](https://traceyplauriault.ca/dataviz/#Infographic&Visualization) You will have to create a free account.  You can also use GoogleDraw and Google Spreadsheets, or any other tool of your choice. In the CULearn Forum, let us know which tools you think you might use for your infographic exercise and note strengths and limitations.


## Week 4 (Oct.3) – Sorting You

This week students learn about the power of classification systems and segmentation techniques.  Students will discover that there may not be ‘natural kinds’ of things but things do get sorted out, and once sorted it is hard to imagine those things in any other way. This will also include an examination of unique identifiers and methods by which data about you is collected in order to situate and put you in your place.

## Week 5 (Oct. 17) – Moving, Locating and Sensing You

In this class student learn about sensors and the work they do in augmenting places, transportation, and mobility.  Students will explore drones, satellites, GPS, LIDAR point clouds, Geiger counters and the visualization of location based services (LBS) data.  The study of sensors will be framed in the context of smart cities, IoT, autonomous cars, transportation, disasters and human rights.

> **INFOGRAPHIC E – (due Oct. 31)**

Have the infographic sketches you posted in the Forum last week on hand.  We will review, discuss, and refine your infographic ideas with your peers in-class.  By the end of the class you will have decided upon your topic, you will have refined your choice of datasets and the way you will render and communicate your infographic story.  During the Study Break you begin visualizing your data using any of the any tools listed [here](https://traceyplauriault.ca/dataviz/) or another tool of your choice.  In the CULearn Forum share a draft title, the topic and explain how you will communicate that topic and how you will create it.

## Week 6 (Oct. 31) – Identifying You

Unique identifiers are a big data enabling technology. These include biometrics, RFID, QRCodes, facial recognition software, barcodes, social-insurance-numbers, postal codes, credit card numbers and etc. Unique IDs not only identify you, but they link you to any number of other datasets and locations.

> **INFOGRAPHIC F – (Due Nov. 7)**

You must submit an image of your DRAFT infographic for peer review.  A student will be assigned to Peer review your infographic.

## Week 7 (Nov. 7) – The Social You

This week we will examine user generated content, citizen science, crowdsourcing & volunteered geographic information. In this lecture we look into data being produced by ‘amateurs’, that may be collected by the ‘crowd’, crowdsourced labour practices and the disruption of formal data producing institutions.

#### Reading:

Read the description on CULearn.  In-Class we will use the infographic peer review assessment tool to evaluate the drafts of a couple of brave students.

## Week 8 (Nov. 14) – Watching You

State institutions are often engaged in surveillance activities.  The Canadian Border Service is one such institution, and airports are a unique assemblage of surveillance technologies, data collection and systems.  Sometimes surveillance is to reduce harm, detect fraud and cheating, and other times it is to monitor behaviour in order to either serve you better or to market to you.  This week students discover concepts such as dataveillance, sousveillance, counterveillance, and surveillance.

* Chapter 3: Analyzing Our Data, 33-45

## Week 9 (Nov. 21) – Big Data You

In this lecture students explore what drives government and the private sector to embrace big data and its practices.  Student study how statistical agencies might use big data for national reporting and we will discuss the implications of doing so. Student will learn to distinguish big data from small data and the characteristics of big data.

#### Readings:

* Siegel, Eric. (2013) With Power Comes Responsibility: Hewlett-Packard, Target and the Police Deduce Your Secrets in [_Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who will Click, Buy, Lie or Die_](http://catalogue.library.carleton.ca/record=b3850835), New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons. 37-65.

> **INFOGRAPHIC G**

You will receive the review from your peers, and you should be working on your infographic, responding to your peer reviewer suggestions, and ask for help on the forum if you need it.

## Week 10 (Nov. 28) – Remembering you

Up to this points students have primarily examined data collected by corporations, the government, or crowdsourced data.  This week students learn about the data collected by researchers, how those data are paid for and what happens to them once collected.  Students will learn about archives and why these remain critical infrastructures in the 21st century big data era.  Student will study data as cultural artifacts, and as historical markers of key social, cultural and political events.

#### Readings:

> **INFOGRAPHIC I** – Polish your infographic and ask for help on the forum if you need it.

## Week 11 (Dec. 5) – Assembling you

This week students examine an approach to the study big data called an assemblage.  Students will learn to think about data as discourse and as a socio-technological assemblage. This will include defining what big data are, and brief overview of some of the enablers of big data.  This framework will be illustrated with a sports analytics example.

#### Reading:

Kitchin, Rob and Lauriault, Tracey P. (2014) [_Towards Critical Data Studies: Charting and Unpacking Data Assemblages and Their Work._](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2474112 )The Programmable City Working Paper 2; pre-print version of chapter to be published in Eckert, J., Shears, A. and Thatcher, J. (eds) Geoweb and Big Data. University of Nebraska Press.

> SUBMIT INFOGRAPHIC – along with the text. 

## Week 12 (Dec. 9) – Review

It all comes together.  In-class we will examine the knowledge gained in the past 11 weeks and we will use the assemblage framework to guide our understanding of big data and society.  We will also prepare for the final exam.
